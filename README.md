# Flood Shocks and Rural Out-migration: Evidence from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India

Abstract
This essay investigates the propensity of households to migrate out of rural regions in re-
sponse to recurring flood shocks, employing an innovative metric of flood exposure‚Äî state-level
flood damage. I use a logistic regression model with annual rainfall intensity as an instrument
for flood damage. Analyzing a nationally representative household survey dataset, that longitu-
dinally tracks 2,610 migrant households from 1980 to 2007 in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states of
India, I document three key findings. First, a one percent increase in flood damage elevates the
likelihood of rural household out-migration by 82.1%, when holding other factors constant. Sec-
ond, an in-depth analysis of the migration mechanism reveals that affected population density
in respective flooding regions is a predominant driver of this impact. This study also attempts
to capture the inter-generational altruism factor influencing households‚Äô decisions to migrate
permanently and ascertains the loss of cattle lives due to floods as the most significant precursor.
Third, the effects are more pronounced among socio-economically disadvantaged households and
those with female heads, highlighting the compounded vulnerabilities they face during extreme
flooding events. Finally, I project migration patterns from 2007 to 2017 and observe a general
trend of stability of historical impact. This hints at a ‚Äôlearning effect‚Äô‚Äî resilience or adaptation
of the population to existing flood risks, and/or effective flood management and mitigation
strategies in severely affected regions.

Datasets and Methodology

I obtained the household-level migration dataset from the 2008 NSSO‚Äôs12 64th round of
the nationally-representative household-level survey. Table I (see Appendix B) stores descriptive
statistics for the socio-economic characteristics of the sample households. This dataset is unique
as it captures how many years ago the household migrated and the nature of the movement.
I utilize this detail to longitudinalize the dataset and observe households 350-500 households
on average migrating from 1980- 2007. Figure II plots the distribution of yearly proportions
of households sampled that out-migrated from 1980 to 2007 using a Kernel Density Estimate.
The plot peaks at 0.35, suggesting that the proportion centers around 35%, with a significant
concentration of proportions between 20% and 50%. The outcome variable of interest is binary: whether Household ùëñ migrates out of a rural
region or an urban region. The dataset provides information solely on the type of the last usual
12The survey was administered by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) under the Ministry of Statistics
and Program Implementation (MoSPI) of the Government of India (GoI). The 64th round of the NSSO‚Äôs
Employment and Unemployment and Migration household survey provides the most recent and comprehensive
dataset on migration from government sources in India. This dataset encompasses the entire Indian Union,
excluding Leh (Ladakh) and Kargil districts in Jammu and Kashmir, interior villages of Nagaland beyond
5km of the bus route, and villages in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands that are inaccessible throughout the
year. The primary sampling unit is household ùëñ within district ùëë. The survey collected responses from 125,578
households, of which 9,331 households are pertinent to this study. The reference period of the survey was from
July 1st, 1999 to June 30st, 2000 (NSSO, 2001).

This survey dataset is merged with state-level flood damage records (in Rupee Crores)
collected from the Central Water Commission (CWC)14 of India whose summary statistics are
stored in Table II. The considerable standard deviations throughout these periods suggest that
the extent of flood damage experienced significant variability, highlighting the unpredictability
and changing impact of floods over time.

Endogenity concerns: IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)16 finds that structural and
non-structural measures like early warning systems, climate services, and social safety nets,
etc cushion losses in case of inland flooding (medium-high confidence). Other factors include
the region‚Äôs development level encompassing physical infrastructure and human capital, flood
management response, the efficacy of these responses amidst the increased frequency of shocks,
improved political coordination, civil society pressure, informational advantages, etc.
